This is a simple Python command to connect the Keysight Signal generator using the Python module called PyVISA.
More about PyVISA can be found in 
https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
This is my attempt to connect and run it. 
I successfully did it for my case, you may consider changing the codes and logic as you want.
Recently, i found that pyvisa works with Tektronix Arbitrary wave generator also.
